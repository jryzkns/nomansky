We assume that the inputted file is in UTF-8 and has the correct formatting, like this:

0-0-0
1-1-1
2-2-2

There is validation to check that the file exists, but not validation to check the inside of the file itself

Also, since it isn't explicitly stated, I assumed that mild and amazing explosions have an equal chance of occuring (50/50), and thus have set it up as such.

As well, since it didnt say we can't, we have the user pick out which planet is PythonPlanet, and show it accordingly.
