The project was done by Brian Fu and I(Jack Zhou), we originally had Daniel Lee in our in our group too, but he ended up leaving because he did not take the ownership over the code that we were creating and as a result had no idea what was happening until the last moment, and he decided to quit and work on it himself. Also on the same note, we have nothing against him, but we are really afraid that daniel might use things from out project because we entrusted him with everything we had before he branched off to do his thing.

Regardless, the project was split into two pieces among Brian and I. I worked on the graphics(which is quite a major component of this project), file import, and the setup of Data Structures while Brian worked on the back-end material: The user input validation, the core game mechanics, and calculations. The Project did not take a significant amount of time to complete, but we as a team found it an extremely educational experience, as we learned to use and collaborate our work with greater ease through github. Brian also taught me how to not write in speghetti just because I'm hungry because the act of doing so makes him hungry too.
