#Main loop

#Level 0 (imports and base/global definitions)

#local imports
import graphics as gfx #important ones are AmazingExplosion, MildExplosion, and travel (these work regardless of gfx!)
#AE destroys planet as well and does gfx, ME is only gfx, and travel assigns a coord. as well as does gfx
import nongfx as ngfx #important is DiceRoll(num)
#DE rolls a num sided die

planets=[] #need mutable global list to manipulate in init 
#this is where the opened file data will be stored, in syntax of the singular planets in a matrix

#Level 0.5 (define gfx data)

#Define gfx planet data
##Planet data if gfx: calculations, isPythonPlanet, coordinate position, visual data, range position
##Planet Data if not gfx: calcs, isPythonPlanet, range position
##calculations are done as [civ lvl, fuel on planet, rocks on planet]
##if civ lvl = 0 then no aliens
##this would be so much easier with objects
